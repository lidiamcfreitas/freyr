# How to collaborate
1. Document everything through **issues**. These need to include a definition of done: the acceptance critera for it to be  done. Newly created issues will be added to the backlog
2. Assign a value/return for that to be implemented
3. Discuss with the team what is the effort estimated for the issue. (Planning poker)
4. Discuss with the team which issues go in the next sprint -> should be moved to the to-do list and the order.
5. Take first item from the to-do list, move it to the in progress list and work on it, only one item at a time, until the all the criteria are met.
